# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

This project is a data analysis notebook designed to track and visualize global COVID-19 trends. It focuses on analyzing confirmed cases, deaths, and vaccination progress across different countries using real-world data.

The notebook uses Python's powerful data science libraries to explore trends over time and across regions, with clear visualizations and insights for presentation or reporting.
